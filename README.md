# Sign Language Glove
Sign language glove project for the bachelor thesis.

A program for automatic sign language translation. The device is a glove to which various sensors are attached, which allow you to read numerical data from the device. By collecting enough of this data, it is possible to obtain a data set for a specific character that needs to be recognized. Using a dataset, a machine learning algorithm is created that will recognize new data based on the created dataset. Thus associating the data from the glove with a specific symbol.

A program in C was written to read the data. Python was used to process the data.
